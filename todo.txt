Next up:
Create a test database
    currently tests put test data straight into the real DB
    there should ideally be an isolated test DB
Create a middleware folder
    The CORS stuff can go in there
    other things like auth will also end up in there
Defensive programming when retrieving data from DB
    Documents could be the wrong shape
    even if my app always write the right shape
    for now only need to check username and bank name
    the capital fields will eventually be located somewhere else

HIGH LEVEL THINGS:

Create some investment instruments
    HYSA
        very safe but low returns, something like 5%
        This requires some kind of Central bank rate for it to follow
    Bonds
        Higher volatility but higher returns, around 8%
    Stocks
        Higher volatility again, but gives around 10%
    Crypto
        Very high volatility, returns essentially same as HYSA
    Lottery
        Each £ invested has lets say 100000:1 odds of winning
        Mean expected return is 1

Design the DB
    A user can log on at any time uring the day and make changes to their investments
    The following day (not immediately), those investments will be applied to other players
    So we need a kind of holding/staging part of the DB, which remembers the changes that need to be made, but doesn't actually make the changes yet

Get actual authentication working
    It should be fairly simple auth, no SSO or MFA or anything (yet)
    I've never done auth stuff before though so I'm not sure where to start

Make a dev-only button that manually advances to the next day
    At some point I need to think about what 'dev-only' actually means

After everything above is in place, there's nothing stopping me from implementing the actual game
    As in, allowing a user to log in, invest in some investments, advance to the next day, make more changes etc
    Allow adding investments, modifying existing investments, removing investments
    Also this is where I'd need to create fake banks that you can invest in
    Also fake other players who can invest in your bank
    And of course all the other stuff like lawyers etc
    When I get to this stage, this bullet point will probably be split into like 50 bullet points

Make a tutorial
    When you first log in, Grandma lends you some money so you can get started
    To start with you only have access to some low-risk instruments
    Then introduce game mechanics one-by-one
    Important to not make the tutorial too long, since each 'turn' is a day
        Don't want it to take a week before you can even play the game
        So need to think of a way to cram lots of changes into the first couple of 'turns'

Other things to consider
    Inflation
        If you put your money in a HYSA and never lie, you'll keep making more money
        So the total amount of money in the system will keep going up
        So do lawyers etc need to become more expensive over time?
        What about when £1m is eventually considered a tiny amount? Do I just routinely divide everyone's money by 1000 or something?
    Rewards for logging in each day
        Sometimes people might find simply leaving their money in stocks and never managing anything might be a reasonable strategy
        So I guess every day there's a chance of something bad happening that the player needs to avoid
        But I feel like there should be a good thing for logging in too, like a new investor or reduced fixed costs
    Monetisation?
        Probably way too early to think about this but who knows, maybe this project will actually get finished some day
