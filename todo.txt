Next up:
Create some investment instruments
    HYSA - very safe but low returns, something like 5%
    Bonds - Higher volatility but higher returns, around 8%
    Stocks - Higher volatility again, but gives around 10%
    Crypto - Very high volatility, returns essentially same as HYSA
Create a test database
    currently tests put test data straight into the real DB
    there should ideally be an isolated test DB
Make a dev-only button that manually advances to the next day
    At some point I need to think about what 'dev-only' actually means
Design the DB
    A player can log on at any time during the day and make changes to their investments
        Need some kind of holding area
    Every time you invest in an asset, you might also become an investor
        So need some kind of investor -> investee collection
Think about how the profits etc work
    Like how do I handle chains of banks all investing in each other
    does it work itself numerically
    do the percentages make sense

FUTURE THINGS:

Defensive programming when retrieving data from DB
    Documents could be the wrong shape
    even if my app always write the right shape
    for now only need to check username and bank name
    the capital fields will eventually be located somewhere else

Make sure /bank caters to multiple banks per player
    Currently it does a FindOne to get the only bank for this player
    this will break later on
    Create a separate /newBank endpoint
    The dashboard really should list all the player's banks, and then you can look into one to see performance

Make a tutorial
    When you first log in, Grandma lends you some money so you can get started
    To start with you only have access to some low-risk instruments
    Then introduce game mechanics one-by-one
    Important to not make the tutorial too long, since each 'turn' is a day
        Don't want it to take a week before you can even play the game
        So need to think of a way to cram lots of changes into the first couple of 'turns'

JWT secret
    What is this?
    Need to do some research

Other things to consider
    Inflation
        If you put your money in a HYSA and never lie, you'll keep making more money
        So the total amount of money in the system will keep going up
        So do lawyers etc need to become more expensive over time?
        What about when £1m is eventually considered a tiny amount?
        Do I just routinely divide everyone's money by 1000 or something?
        or maybe whenever the cheapest thing in the game reaches £1000, divide everything by 1000
    Rewards for logging in each day
        Sometimes people might find simply leaving their money in stocks and never managing anything might be a reasonable strategy
        So I guess every day there's a chance of something bad happening that the player needs to avoid
        But I feel like there should be a good thing for logging in too, like a new investor or reduced fixed costs
    Monetisation?
        Probably way too early to think about this but who knows, maybe this project will actually get finished some day
