Tidy up the ramblings about resolving banks - combine into one file

Next up:
Make all purchases come out of cash
Apply pending transactions on new day
Ensure currencies are stored in correct format
    Need to be displayed to the user as ints
    Need to be stored as floating points
    Also need to be huge, both positive and negative
Redesign header so that claimed and actual capitals are in same graph
Somehow prevent services from being passed into other services


FUTURE THINGS:

Some logging would be nice

Defensive programming when retrieving data from DB
    Documents could be the wrong shape
    even if my app always write the right shape
    for now only need to check username and bank name
    the capital fields will eventually be located somewhere else

Allow player to create additional banks
    This will mean a redesign of the dashboard where a player can select their bank

Add 'Today'/'Tomorrow' buttons
    To highlight what happened from yesterday to today
        new investors
        any withdrawals
        any new potential investments
        legal issues or whatever
    and what will happen from today to tomorrow
        how much will you lie
        what you will buy/sell
        any upcoming events or whatever

Make a tutorial
    When you first log in, Grandma lends you some money so you can get started
    To start with you only have access to some low-risk instruments
    Then introduce game mechanics one-by-one
    Important to not make the tutorial too long, since each 'turn' is a day
        Don't want it to take a week before you can even play the game
        So need to think of a way to cram lots of changes into the first couple of 'turns'

JWT secret
    What is this?
    Need to do some research

Caching
    Very little changes throughout the day
    Making the same request twice will almost always return the same thing
    Might as well put everything in a cache

Other things to consider
    Inflation
        If you put your money in a HYSA and never lie, you'll keep making more money
        So the total amount of money in the system will keep going up
        So do lawyers etc need to become more expensive over time?
        What about when £1m is eventually considered a tiny amount?
        Do I just routinely divide everyone's money by 1000 or something?
        or maybe whenever the cheapest thing in the game reaches £1000, divide everything by 1000
    Rewards for logging in each day
        Sometimes people might find simply leaving their money in stocks and never managing anything might be a reasonable strategy
        So I guess every day there's a chance of something bad happening that the player needs to avoid
        But I feel like there should be a good thing for logging in too, like a new investor or reduced fixed costs
    Monetisation?
        Probably way too early to think about this but who knows, maybe this project will actually get finished some day
        I'm thinking you could pay for some level of automation
            Like you could collect your daily perks without having to log in
            Or you could have a layer of protection against whatever bad things happen when you don't log in
            But then again that encourages people to not log in, which is kinda the opposite of what I want
        Or you could just pay for money
            But then it's a pay to win game
